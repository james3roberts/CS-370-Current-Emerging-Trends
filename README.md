What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists help solve problems that are complex or simple and are a waste of time. 
If the problem is complex, this allows the computer to do the calucations. They are so much faster
and efficient it makes sense. This also leads to quicker solutions which equals quicker results. 
If the problem is simple and a waste of time, computer scientists create a way to make it simple or
automated, leaving more time for other things. 
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach problems by breaking them down into steps and then just solve each step until the problem is solved. 
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and organization?
My ethical responsibility is to keep user and organization save and keep thier information safe. It is also my job to not 
create something that will cause harm.
